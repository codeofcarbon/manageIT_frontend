## Overview

SDA course final project - a program modeled on the Jira management tool, supporting agile work methodology.

It is a group graduate project carried out at the final stage of the SDA course. Working on a group project, and thus the opportunity to work in a team while creating the application allowed us to take a broader look at the problems being solved, and above all, it allowed us to learn more about working in the gitflow system. The project is based on MVC architectural design pattern and implements a REST web service structure divided into the back and front-end parts.
